# Tutorial

Tutorials are available in the examples folder of Spectra.jl (https://github.com/charlesll/Spectra.jl/tree/master/examples) and include notebooks showing how to fit peaks in a Raman spectrum of a glass after subtraction of a baseline. Another example shows how to use Spectra.jl to peak-fit Infrared spectra taken along a diffusion profile in a crystal. Further examples will be added in a very soon future!
