# To Do

## Pre-Processing

- Adding access to the SMOOTH spline library, used by the csaps Matlab function.

## Integration

- gaussianarea will change in peakarea, with the option to choose between the shape of the peak (gaussian, lorentzian, etc.) ??

- Should we think to add Simpson's rule integration also?

- Moving Average smoothing ?
