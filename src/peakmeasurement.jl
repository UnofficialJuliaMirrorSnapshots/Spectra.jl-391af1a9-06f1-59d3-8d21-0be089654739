	peakmeas(x::Array{Float64},y::Array{Float64};smoothing = "yes", filter = :SavitzkyGolay, M=5,N=2,ese_y=1.,y_smo_out=false)

The peakmeas function allows performing measurements of the position, width, intensity and centro誰d of a dominant peak in a provided x-y signal.

It smooths the signal with a Savitzky-Golay filter prior to measuring the peak position, width and intensity. It is advised to check that the M and N values of the Savitzky-Golay filter are adequate for your problem before trusting the results from peakmeas. For that, just use the y_smo_out option. 

half-width at half-maximum are calculated as the width of the peak at half its maximum intensity. This calculation is not affected by any asumption of peak symmetry (no fitting is done).

Centro誰d is calculated as sum(y./sum(y).*x).

INPUTS:
	
	x: Array{Float64}, the x values;

	y: Array{Float64}, the y values.

OPTIONS:

	smoothing, String, triggers the smoothing of the spectrum if set to yes (default value);
	
	filter, Symbol, the filter that will be used. See the smooth function documentation;

	M=5, the M parameter for smoothing y with a Savitzky-Golay filter. See smooth function documentation;

	N=2, the M parameter for smoothing y with a Savitzky-Golay filter. See smooth function documentation;

	y_smo_out=false, the smoothed signal. Signal will be smoothed if set to true, using the SavitzkyGolayFilter function with the M and N values. y_smo output will also be provided.
	
OUTPUTS:

	intensity: Float64, the intensity of the peak;
	
	position: Float64, the position of the peak;
	
	hwhm: Float64, the half-width at half-maximum of the peak;
	
	centro誰d: Float64, the centro誰d of the peak;
	
	if y_smo_out is set to true, then another output is provided:
	
	y_smo: Array{Float64}, the smoothed y signal.
